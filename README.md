# pdf-tools

PDF Tools for Visual Studio Code offers a set of functions dealing with PDF files:
* Preview (multiple pages)
* Extract pages(divide every n-pages or all selected into one file)
* Combine different PDF files into a single one
* Combine two pages into one (e.g. 2xA4=>A3, 2xA5=>A4)
* Split pages into two (e.g. A3=>2xA4, A4=>2xA5)
* Rotate
* ...

## Motiviation
There are lots of tools offering PDF capabilities - none of those had all the options I needed in a single place. That's the target of this tool.

It's just a hobby project ;-)

## Why as a VSCode plugin?
Laziness... It was the most convenient way to bring the features written in JS/TS into an OS-independent frontend without the need to run an application server.
